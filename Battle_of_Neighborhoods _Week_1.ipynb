    "Certainly, I can use available real estate apps and Google but the idea is to use and apply myself the learned tools during the course.\n",

    " - apartment must be 2 or 3 bedrooms\n",
    " - desired location is near a metro station in the Manhattan area and within 1.0 mile (1.6 km) radius\n",
    " - price of rent not exceed $7,000 per month\n",
    " - top ammenities in the selected neighborhood shall be similar to current residence\n",
    " - desirable to have venues such as coffee shops, restaurants Asian Thai, wine stores, gym and food shops\n",

This case is also applicable for anyone interested in exploring starting or locating a new business in any city. Lastly, it can also serve as a good practical exercise to develop Data Science skills.\n"

    "- Use Foursquare and geopy data to map top 10 venues for all Manhattan neighborhoods and clustered in groups ( as per Course LAB)\n",
    "- Use foursquare and geopy data to map the location of subway metro stations , separately and on top of the above clustered map in order to be able to identify the venues and ammenities near each metro station, or explore each subway location separately\n",
    "- Use Foursquare and geopy data to map the location of rental places, in some form, linked to the subway locations.\n",
    "- create a map that depicts, for instance, the average rental price per square ft, around a radious of 1.0 mile (1.6 km) around each subway station - or a similar metrics. I will be able to quickly point to the popups to know the relative price per subway area.\n",

    "- What is the distance from work place ( Park Ave and 53 rd St) and the tentative future home?\n",
    "- What are the venues of the two best places to live? How the prices compare?\n",
    "- How venues distribute among Manhattan neighborhoods and around metro stations?\n",
    "- Are there tradeoffs between size and price and location?\n",
